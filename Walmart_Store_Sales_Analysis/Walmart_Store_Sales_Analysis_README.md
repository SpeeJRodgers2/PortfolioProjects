# Walmart Store Sales Analysis
#### Description:     In this project, I wanted to see what type of data in the dataset between temperature, fuel price, CPI, & unemployment rate has an affect on weekly sales.

The dataset has weekly sales data across 45 different Walmart stores from many different regions. It also gives the average temperature of that week's sales along with the price of fuel, the consumer price index (CPI), & unemployment rate in that store's region. Lastly, there is a 0 or 1 in a "holiday" column to indicate whether there was a significant holiday that week.

First, I made a pivot table using each store, 1-45, as a row of the pivot table. The columns took averages of weekly sales, temperature, fuel price, CPI, & unemployment. I copy and pasted that data out of the pivot table, so the data can be used in future calculations. I used each stores average data to subtract from it's weekly data to determine whether it was above or below average that week. It's critical that each store's average data was used to find this difference instad of the overall averages since each store is from a different region and should be treated individually to come to accurate conclusions about the overall data. This created 5 new columns of data that can be used to find a correlation between eachother. 

Now, I used the CORREL function to find the correlation between weekly sales above or below average and each of temperature, fuel price, CPI, & unemployment above or below average. This yielded VERY low correlation numbers for each relationship. They all were .1 or lower negative or positive. To put that into perspective a strong correlation is 1 or -1. Something that I believe plays into these correlation numbers being so small is that the difference between the actual and the averages of temperature, fuel price, CPI, & unemployment are MUCH smaller than between weekly sales numbers. Weekly sales numbers could be well over 1 million dollars different while the other data points have double/single digit differences or even less! However, we can still take the correlation number being positive or negative as real data. This indicates whether the numbers have an inverse relationship or not.

In the above chart we can see that temperature, fuel price, & unemployment have a negatively correlated or inverse relationship with sales. This means that sales should go up if any of those data points go down and vice versa. We also see that CPI and sales have a positively correlated relationship, so CPI and sales should move up and down together.

Correlation can be tricky data because totally random data that has nothing to do with eachother can appear to have a relationship, so I want to dig deeper and check these relationships further. To start, I used the COUNTIFS function to count the occurences of each potential relationship. For example, it counted the number of times that weekly sales for a store was above it's average AND temperature was above it's average for that store's region. It also counted the number of occurences (counts) of all the other possible combinations of those statistics being above or below their average. Next, I found the overall count of times that sales were above and below their average. There was actually over 1,000 more occurences of sales being below average than above. That's why we needed those numbers, because the only way to accurately compare the number of times sales are above or below average due to another statistic is by taking the percentage of times it occurs. To find that, I divided the counts of sales above average with X (temperature, fuel price, CPI, or unemployment) above average and then below average by the overall count of times sales were above average. The same thing was done again for sales being below average. This yielded valuable data that will be seen in the charts below. There will also be data with those same percentages with weeks that have significant holidays occuring in them removed. I did this because it's reasonable to assume that consumers will be less price sensitive during holiday weeks, and that could potentially skew the data. You will see that removing holiday weeks didn't have much of an effect on the resulting data, but it is still good to check! Now, I will go over the analysis of each relationship under their respective chart.

The weekly sales and temperature relationship is a perfect place to start because it's a great example of how correlation can lie. According to the correlation chart, temperature should have the strongest correlation with weekly sales out of each relationship that we're looking at. However, the chart above shows that there is no real correlation between temperature and weekly sales! The correlation we calculated was negative, so that means that weekly sales and temperature should move inversly or in the opposite direction of eachother. Let's look at the blue column above. You'll see that when weekly sales were above average, temperature is more often than not above average as-well (~52% of the time). That would suggest they are positively correlated, but then we look at the percentages when weekly sales is below average. Temperature is more often than not above average (~54% of the time) which would suggest they're negatively correlated. I believe this shows that the correlation calculated between weekly sales and temperature is simply a bogus statistic. There is also sound reasoning that can be put behind this claim. If you need something from the store, you aren't more or less likely to go depending on the temperature being a few degrees higher or lower. This is especially true for a store like Walmart that sells peoples' needs. They will need groceries, clothes, or medicine regardless of wether it's summer or winter. 

![Weekly Sales Vs. CPI Relationships](https://github.com/SpeeJRodgers2/PortfolioProjects/blob/main/Walmart_Store_Sales_Analysis/Charts/Weekly%20Sales%20Vs.%20CPI%20Relationships.png)

Let's see if the positive correlation seen on the correlation chart between weekly sales and CPI stacks up. CPI or the consumer price index has certainly come back into the lime-light since 2021. That's because it measure inflation. A positive correlation between weekly sales and CPI suggests that as things get more expensive that weekly sales go up. At first glance, this sounds counter intuitive. Won't people buy less goods since they are more expensive? Yes! However, as stated in my analysis of weekly sales vs. temeprature, Walmart sells things people need! If people are still buying what they need and those things are now more expensive, weekly sales numbers would actually increase! This relationship is clearly validated in the above chart. When weekly sales are above average, CPI is typically above average (~54% of the time) seen in the blue column. When weekly sales are below average, CPI is also below average (~55% of the time) seen in the green column. 

![Weekly Sales Vs. Fuel Price Relationships](https://github.com/SpeeJRodgers2/PortfolioProjects/blob/main/Walmart_Store_Sales_Analysis/Charts/Weekly%20Sales%20Vs.%20Fuel%20Price%20Relationships.png)

The relationship between weekly sales and fuel price should be pretty straightforward... right? Well, the correlation chart shows a negative correlation or an inverse relationship between weekly sales and fuel price. That makes sense. If people are paying more for gas, they won't have as much money to spend on goods at Walmart. However, (oh not another however) the above chart disagrees! In the chart you'll notice that fuel price is typically above average regardless of whether weekly sales is above or below average. This is another conflicting relationship that we saw when viewing the weekly sales vs. temperature relationship. The data may be slightly skewed by the number of times that fuel prices are above average in the dataset. It's the second largest gap between number of times being above or below average, right behind weekly sales, at almost 900 more occurences of fuel prices being above average compared to below. I also believe that the relationship between CPI and fuel price plays a role in skewing the data. I used the CORREL function on fuel price above and below average with CPI above and below average to find that they are highly correlated in a positive way (yielding .755). This makes sense because fuel prices are included in the CPI calculation so they should be correlated and in a positive way. All that to say, fuel prices aren't a solid indicator of weekly sales.

Lastly, let's go over the relationship between weekly sales and unemployment. It should be pretty straightforward... right? Actually, YES! This relationship had the second strongest correlation on the very first chart, and this chart above definitely confirms that! The correlation is negative, so they should have an inverse relationship. This is clearly shown by looking at the red and yellow columns. When weekly sales are above average, the unemployment rate is usually below average (~53% of the time). When weekly sales are below average, the unemployment rate is usually above average (~59% of the time). People don't have money to spend when they don't have a job.

I learned a good bit from this project, and I hope you can take something away from my data analysis as-well. Further analysis could be done by looking at the direction of these numbers from week to week instead of whether they are above or below their averages to find more insights. Feel free to try obseerving those insights with this data. I'll be moving onto to my next project. Thank you so much for reading!
